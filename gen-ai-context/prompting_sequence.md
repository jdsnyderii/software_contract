## Step 1 : Generate LinkML Schema

**Prompt**:

please generate a linkml schema that represents a software system contract that includes the following abstractions:
preconditions, postconditions, invariants, behavior description. Additionally, I would like the contract schema to
include the systems that are calling this contract as well as any dependent contracts to satisfy the conditions or
behaviors. Also, please include metadata about who the contract authors are and a place for reviewer comments.

## Step 2: Refine to use LinkML meta to generate a Generator

so this was a very good start.
However, I don't think we are leveraging the structure of LinkML to generate the views and view controllers for Django
be iterating over the LinkML metadata to generate the Django code instead of maintaining it by after you generated the
code for me. I need a meta-driven generator that uses the LinkML schema to help automate the maintenance.

## Step 3: Dockerize

## Step 4: Dockerize on Python 3.13

excellent instructions.
The last think that I need help with is for you to generate a Dockerfile that will allow me to both build and run the
app inside the a Container so that I do not have to install python code on my local computer to make this run.


## Add a visualizer

Great that fixed the bug!
Can you add some control buttons for zoom in and out as well as a button to relayout the diagram?
