To run the Django-based Software Contract Editor inside a Docker container without installing Python or dependencies
locally, we need a `Dockerfile` that sets up the environment, installs all required dependencies, and configures the
Django application to run. The `Dockerfile` will:

- Use an official Python base image.
- Install the dependencies specified in the project (e.g., `linkml-runtime`, `django`, etc.).
- Copy the generated Django project files (from the `generate_django_app.py` script).
- Set up the Django application, run migrations, and start the development server.
- Expose the necessary port for accessing the editor.

Additionally, we’ll include a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify building and running the container, and a
`requirements.txt` file to list dependencies explicitly. These files will be included within the artifact as comments,
with instructions for placement, since only one artifact is allowed per response.

### Assumptions

- The Django project files are generated by the `generate_django_app.py` script and are located in the
  `generated_django_app` directory (or copied to the project root).
- The project structure includes:
  ```
  /contract_editor/
    /contract_app/
      models.py
      serializers.py
      views.py
      urls.py
    /templates/
      index.html
    /contract_editor/
      settings.py
      urls.py
    manage.py
  ```
- The application uses SQLite as the database (as configured in `settings.py`), which is suitable for development and
  works out-of-the-box in a container.

### Dockerfile Overview

- **Base Image**: Use `python:3.9-slim` for a lightweight Python environment.
- **Dependencies**: Install system dependencies (e.g., `gcc` for building Python packages) and Python dependencies from
  `requirements.txt`.
- **Project Setup**: Copy the project files, set up the working directory, and run Django migrations.
- **Run Command**: Start the Django development server on `0.0.0.0:8000` to allow external access.

### Artifact

The artifact is the `Dockerfile`, with `docker-compose.yml` and `requirements.txt` included as comments for placement
instructions. The `Dockerfile` assumes the project files are in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the Django project files
COPY .. .

# Expose port 8000 for the Django development server
EXPOSE 8000

# Run migrations and start the Django development server
CMD ["sh", "-c", "python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"]

# Place the following files in the same directory as the Dockerfile

# File: requirements.txt
# ---
# linkml-runtime==1.5.4
# jinja2==3.1.2
# django==4.2.7
# djangorestframework==3.14.0
# django-cors-headers==4.3.1
# pyyaml==6.0.1
# ---

# File: docker-compose.yml
# ---
# version: '3.8'
# 
# services:
#   web:
#     build:
#       context: .
#       dockerfile: Dockerfile
#     ports:
#       - "8000:8000"
#     volumes:
#       - .:/app
#     environment:
#       - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
# ---
```

### How to Use the Dockerfile

1. **Prepare the Project Directory**:
    - Run the `generate_django_app.py` script to generate the Django project files (as described in the previous
      response).
    - Copy the generated files to a new directory (e.g., `contract_editor`):
      ```
      /contract_editor/
        /contract_app/
          models.py
          serializers.py
          views.py
          urls.py
        /templates/
          index.html
        /contract_editor/
          settings.py
          urls.py
        manage.py
      ```
    - Create the following files in the `contract_editor` directory:
        - `Dockerfile`: Copy the content from the artifact above.
        - `requirements.txt`: Copy the content from the commented section in the artifact.
        - `docker-compose.yml`: Copy the content from the commented section in the artifact.

2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**:
    - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system:
        - Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
        - Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
    - Navigate to the `contract_editor` directory:
      ```bash
      cd contract_editor
      ```
    - Build and run the container using Docker Compose:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
      This command:
        - Builds the Docker image based on the `Dockerfile`.
        - Starts the container, mapping port `8000` on your host to port `8000` in the container.
        - Runs migrations and starts the Django development server.

3. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`.
    - You should see the Software Contract Editor interface.

4. **Stop the Container**:
    - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the container.
    - Alternatively, run:
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```

### Alternative: Build and Run with Docker Directly

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, you can build and run the container manually:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t contract-editor .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm contract-editor
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
    - Go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

### Notes

- **SQLite Database**: The application uses SQLite, stored in `db.sqlite3` in the project directory. The
  `docker-compose.yml` mounts the project directory as a volume, so the database persists between container restarts. If
  you use `docker run` without a volume, the database will be lost when the container stops.
- **Production Considerations**:
    - The `Dockerfile` uses the Django development server (`runserver`), which is not suitable for production. For
      production, use a WSGI server like `gunicorn` and configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx).
    - Replace the `SECRET_KEY` in `settings.py` with a secure value and store it as an environment variable.
    - Restrict `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS` in `settings.py` to specific origins.
    - Consider using a production-ready database like PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.
- **Dependencies**: The `requirements.txt` pins specific versions for reproducibility. You can update versions as
  needed, but ensure compatibility with the generated code.
- **Port Conflicts**: If port `8000` is in use, modify the `ports` section in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `"8080:8000"`)
  or use a different port with `docker run` (e.g., `-p 8080:8000`).
- **File Permissions**: On some systems, Docker may create files (e.g., `db.sqlite3`) with root permissions. If this
  causes issues, run `chown` to fix ownership:
  ```bash
  sudo chown $USER:$USER db.sqlite3
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Build Fails**: Ensure all project files are in place and the `requirements.txt` is correct. Check for typos or
  missing files.
- **Container Exits Immediately**: Check the container logs for errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```
  Common issues include missing dependencies or syntax errors in the generated code.
- **Cannot Access `localhost:8000`**: Verify the container is running (`docker ps`) and the port is correctly mapped.
  Check for firewall restrictions.
- **Database Errors**: If migrations fail, ensure the `manage.py` script and `settings.py` are correctly configured.
  Delete `db.sqlite3` and re-run migrations if needed.

### Project Setup Recap

To ensure everything works:

1. Generate the project files using `generate_django_app.py` (requires `linkml-runtime`, `jinja2`, etc., installed
   locally to run the script, but the resulting app runs in Docker).
2. Create the `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and `docker-compose.yml` as specified.
3. Place all files in the `contract_editor` directory.
4. Use `docker-compose up --build` to build and run the application.

This `Dockerfile` and accompanying files allow you to build and run the Software Contract Editor in a containerized
environment, eliminating the need to install Python or dependencies locally. If you encounter any issues during setup or
runtime, please provide the error details, and I’ll help resolve them!
